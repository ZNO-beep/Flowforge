# FlowForge Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines the implementation strategy for the FlowForge application, a modern full-stack application with FastAPI backend and React frontend. The application features a business workflow builder with organizational structure visualization using React Flow.

## Implementation Philosophy

Our implementation approach is guided by these core principles:

1. **Incremental Development**: Build the application in small, testable increments
2. **Component-First Architecture**: Focus on building reusable, well-defined components
3. **Strict Adherence to Coding Rules**: Follow the established coding guidelines in `.cursor/rules/coding_rules.md`
4. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests alongside components
5. **Documentation-as-Code**: Document design decisions and component usage

## Architecture Overview

```

### State Management Strategy

1. **React Flow State**: Use React Flow's built-in hooks for flow-specific state
   - `useNodesState` and `useEdgesState` for nodes and edges
   - `useReactFlow` for flow operations

2. **Component State**: Use React's `useState` for component-specific state

3. **Application State**: Use React Context for shared application state
   - Organizational structure context
   - Workflow builder context
   - User preferences context

## Development Workflow

For each component or feature:

   - Create component specification
   - Identify dependencies

2. **Implementation**
   - Create minimal working version
   - Follow coding guidelines
   - Keep functions under 15 lines
   - Minimize nesting and complexity

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests
   - Test edge cases
   - Verify against requirements

4. **Review**
   - Check against coding guidelines
   - Verify performance
   - Ensure accessibility

5. **Documentation**
   - Add inline documentation
   - Update component documentation
   - Create usage examples

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before considering any component complete, verify:

- [ ] Component follows single responsibility principle
- [ ] Functions are 15 lines or less
- [ ] Nesting is minimized (max 2 levels)
- [ ] Component is properly tested
- [ ] Component is accessible
- [ ] Component is responsive
- [ ] Component is documented
- [ ] Component follows styling guidelines
- [ ] Component handles errors gracefully
- [ ] Component performance is optimized

## Specific Implementation Order

To minimize dependencies and enable incremental testing, we'll implement components in this order:

1. **OrgStructureNode**: The building block for organizational structure
2. **OrgStructureFlow**: The container for organizational nodes
3. **OrgStructurePage**: The user interface for organizational structure
4. **WorkflowNode**: The building block for workflows
5. **WorkflowFlow**: The container for workflow nodes
6. **WorkflowPage**: The user interface for workflow builder
7. **Integration Components**: Components that connect the different parts

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **Performance with Large Graphs**
   - Mitigation: Implement virtualization and optimize rendering
   - Fallback: Add pagination or filtering options

2. **Complex State Management**
   - Mitigation: Clear separation of concerns and well-defined state flow
   - Fallback: Simplify features if needed

3. **AI Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple integration and expand
   - Fallback: Provide manual alternatives

4. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Use polyfills and test across browsers
   - Fallback: Document limitations and provide alternatives

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the FlowForge application. By following this plan and adhering to the coding guidelines, we aim to create a high-quality, maintainable application with minimal bugs and issues.

The plan is a living document and may be updated as the project progresses and requirements evolve.
