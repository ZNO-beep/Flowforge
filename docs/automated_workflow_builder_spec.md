# Automated Business Workflow Builder â€“ UX/UI Specification

## 1. Overview
This application is designed for non-technical small business owners to build automated business workflows with the help of AI. The interface will guide users through a structured process, allowing them to create workflows using a visual drag-and-drop system with AI assistance.

The platform is divided into key sections:
- **Onboarding**
- **Business Department & Function Selection**
- **Workflow Discovery & Creation**
- **Workflow Builder**
- **Testing & Evaluation**
- **Activation & Management**

---

## 2. Onboarding Experience (AI-Driven)
- The **Onboarding AI Agent** will engage users in a brief conversation to collect high-level information:
  - Business Name
  - Type of Business (industry-specific details)
  - Size of Business (optional)
  
- Once basic details are provided, the system will display a **graphical organizational chart** representing common business departments:
  - **Sales**
  - **Marketing**
  - **Accounting**
  - **Human Resources**
  - **Operations**
  - **Customer Support**
  
- The organizational chart will be implemented using **React Flow with ELK.js** for advanced layout capabilities:
  - **Expandable/collapsible nodes** for departments
  - **Visual hierarchy** showing departments, roles, and functions
  - **Interactive elements** for adding new departments, roles, or functions
  - **Drag-and-drop capabilities** for reorganizing the structure
  - **Optimized layout** for complex hierarchies using ELK's advanced algorithms
  
- Users can click on any department to view an **expanded list of business functions** within that department.
  - Example: Selecting **Sales** reveals sub-functions like:
    - Lead Qualification
    - Lead Nurturing
    - Sales Conversion
    - Customer Retention

- The expansion/collapse functionality will be handled through custom React Flow node components that maintain the hierarchical relationship between elements.

- Users can choose a **sub-function** to access:
  - **Existing Workflow Templates** (pre-built workflows related to that function)
  - **User-Created Workflows** (previous workflows built by the user)
  - **Create New Workflow** (redirects to the **Workflow Builder**)

---

## 3. Workflow Builder UX/UI
When creating a new workflow, the user is taken to the **Workflow Builder**, which includes:

### Step 1: AI-Driven Workflow Interview
The AI Agent will guide the user through defining the workflow structure:
- **Goal Definition** (Determines department & sub-function)
- **Required Inputs** (Data sources, manual inputs, AI suggestions)
- **Expected Outputs** (CRM, spreadsheets, email, website, database)

ðŸ‘‰ **Real-time UI update**: As the user answers questions, a **structured data panel** dynamically displays extracted key workflow details.

---

### Step 2: Interactive Workflow Construction
The system will generate a **pre-configured visual workflow editor** with:
- **Drag-and-drop components** for business tasks (e.g., data input, AI processing, API calls)
- **Pre-populated AI Suggestions** for automation steps
- **Editable AI Prompts** for workflows using LLM interactions
- **Built-in Integrations** (Google Sheets, CRMs, Email, etc.)

Users can:
- Modify AI-generated workflow steps
- Customize AI prompts
- Add, remove, or reorder steps
- Define input-output mappings
- Use conditional logic (e.g., if-then automation rules)

---

### Step 3: Workflow Testing & Debugging
- Users can **test their workflow in real-time** with a **Live Debugging Panel**, which:
  - Shows each step's process and data transformation
  - Highlights errors and provides suggestions for fixes
  - Displays what's happening under the hood (e.g., API requests, AI interactions)
  
- The AI **Evaluation Agent** will provide quality control feedback:
  - Checks if workflow logic is sound
  - Identifies missing data points
  - Suggests optimizations

ðŸ‘‰ **Users can interact with the AI via voice or text** during testing.

---

### Step 4: Workflow Activation & Management
- Users can **Save a Draft** (work in progress)
- Once finalized, users can **Activate the Workflow**, making it operational
- Activated workflows appear under the **relevant business department & sub-function**
- Users can:
  - View workflow history & logs
  - Edit and update workflows
  - Pause or deactivate workflows
  - Duplicate workflows for variations

---

## 4. Navigation & UI Structure
The application will have a **left-hand navigation menu** for easy access to:
- **Home Dashboard**
- **Departments & Business Functions**
- **Workflow Builder**
- **Saved & Active Workflows**
- **AI Chat Assistant**
- **Settings & Integrations**

ðŸ‘‰ **Clean, simple UI with minimal text and clear icons for navigation.** The experience is structured yet flexible, allowing users to customize workflows without overwhelming complexity.

---

## 5. Developer Considerations
- **Frontend:** React.js with React Flow for both workflow visualization and organizational structure
- **Custom Node Types:** Specialized React Flow nodes for departments, roles, functions, and workflow steps
- **State Management:** Consistent approach for handling expanded/collapsed states
- **Data Structure:** Hierarchical model for representing organizational elements
- **Backend:** Node.js / Python with AI Agent handling structured interviews
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API or custom LLM-based agent for workflow assistance
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / Firebase for storing workflows and organizational structures
- **Drag-and-Drop:** React Flow for visual workflow creation and organizational management
- **Integrations:** Zapier-like connectors for Google Sheets, Email, CRM, etc.

---

## Final Notes
This UX/UI approach ensures **clarity, ease of use, and automation suggestions** for small business owners who are non-technical. The AI-driven guidance and **interactive workflow testing** make automation accessible while minimizing friction in the user experience.
